      <h1>What is Browser Cache?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body-cache">


      <p>Browser cache is a temporary storage location on your computer downloaded from sites browsed on your browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer). Browser cache keeps track
        of all the site information (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) pulled from the website so that if you were to visit the site again, only pieces of the site that had been
        updated on the site would update in your cache, making the site load faster by reducing the bandwith usage between servers and the users (less internet data usage). The downside of cache is that can take up quite some space,
        so clear it every so often.
      </p>

        <p>Cookies are similar to cache in that it stores information. Rather than site information, cookies store user preferences/data/activity so the next time the user was to visit the site, it wouldn't ask for the same information. MailChimp forms work by recording actions the user took on
        the pop-up form. In order for the pop-up to show again, you must clear your cookies, letting the server "forget" your previous actions with the pop-up.
